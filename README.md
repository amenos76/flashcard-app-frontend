## General info
Subliminal Study is a work-in-progress flash card studying app. As I've been learning how to code I realized I had to re-learn how to study efficiently.  Studying is an active "opt-in" activity and it is far too easy to get distracted. Pick up your phone to answer a simple text and before you know it youâ€™re 45 min deep in cat videos with no studying happening anytime soon.  Subliminal Study has a (coming soon) feature to get you studying without even realizing it!  User are able to choose from pre-made decks/topics as well as add their own decks and cards.  



## Technologies
* Ruby on Rails - version 2.6.1
* Authentication implemented with JWT and BCrypt
* Javascript 
* React Native
* Context API for state management
